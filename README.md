# NCPC 2020 Warmup Repo!
Used to store our solutions and to make cooperation easier :)

Create a folder for each problem, and write a rust or python program in there named after you. For example, if the problem is called "traffic light" create a folder called traffic-light, and then `run cargo new traffic-light-polly` or `touch traffic-light-polly.py` inside the folder. The resulting structure should be `traffic-light\traffic-light-polly`.
